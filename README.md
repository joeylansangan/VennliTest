# Vennli Frontend Developer Code Test

This project is created for Vennli's Frontend Developer code test. Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), this application is fully mobile responsive and utilizes React hooks to reuse stateful logic and share hooks to multiple components without changing the code's component heirarchy.

## Additional Notes

### Tailwind CSS
I used Tailwind CSS for rapid styling and easy mobile responsiveness. 

### CRACO
Create React App doesnâ€™t let you override the PostCSS configuration natively. CRACO plugin is required to enable the configuration of Tailwind CSS.

### CI/CD
Continuous Integration and Deployment is setup for the demo version of this application. The Git repository is connected to Netlify and triggers a publish automatically everytime a commit is pushed.
